## Code Explanation
### **JavaScript Logic**
- The function `generaterandomnstring(length)` generates a **random string** based on the selected length. It uses the **Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm** to randomly shuffle the elements.
- The `generate_password()` function checks the selected radio button to determine the password length and then calls the **random generator** function.
- The `copy_btn` event listener **copies** the generated password to the clipboard.

## Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Add an **option to customize password complexity** (e.g., include/exclude special characters).  
ðŸ”¹ Implement **local storage** to save generated passwords.  
ðŸ”¹ Create a **dark mode** for better UI experience.
